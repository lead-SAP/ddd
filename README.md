"Real-Time Driver Distraction Detection for Android & iOS Devices using Machine Learning Techniques"

AIM: To design and produce a mobile application native to Android and iOS operating
systems that detects driver distractedness and then attempts to correct that action accordingly.

SCOPE: The span of applying the functionality of this application is wide. For example, it can
be used in all sub-fields of commercial transportation (land, air, sea), private transportation (land, air, sea), medical practices and security related professions, etc.

Description: The application will always be running as a background process waiting to detect
a sort of movement which will hint at the individual’s attempt to self-drive a type of machinery. Once certain parameters are met, regarding eyes position, a sharp noise followed by a clear verbal message may be outputted. Moreover, on days such as weekends, public holidays and/or evening hours, concerned authorities may be contacted to alert officials of such an incident in order to avert the occurrence turning into an accident where lives may be at risk.

INPUT:
	Calendar date and time.
	Acceleration & Speed.
	Eye position and movement.
OUTPUT:
	Loud and sharp noise.
	Verbal warning message.
	Contact authorities and provide necessary information.
